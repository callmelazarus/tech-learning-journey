# Logical Fallacies: Complete Overview

Logical fallacies are flawed reasoning patterns that make arguments invalid or misleading, even if they sound persuasive. They involve errors in logic where the conclusion doesn't follow from the premises, or irrelevant information is used to support a claim. Think of fallacies like optical illusions for reasoning—they look convincing at first glance, but closer examination reveals the argument doesn't actually hold up.

## Key Points

- **Fallacy:** Error in reasoning that undermines argument validity
- **Types:** Formal (structural errors) vs Informal (content errors)
- **Common:** Ad hominem, straw man, false dilemma, slippery slope
- **Why Care:** Spot weak arguments, improve critical thinking
- **Not Always Wrong:** Conclusion might be true despite fallacious reasoning

## Summary

**Logical Fallacy:** Flawed reasoning that undermines argument validity.

**Common Fallacies:**
- **Ad Hominem:** Attack person, not argument
- **Straw Man:** Misrepresent argument, attack distortion
- **False Dilemma:** Present only two options
- **Slippery Slope:** Claim one step leads to extreme
- **Appeal to Authority:** Expert says X, therefore true
- **Hasty Generalization:** Small sample → broad conclusion
- **Circular Reasoning:** Conclusion restates premise
- **Post Hoc:** A before B, so A caused B

**Spotting:**
- Does conclusion follow from premises?
- Is argument addressing the actual point?
- What evidence supports this?
- Are emotions replacing logic?

**Rule of thumb:** Attack arguments, not people. Consider all options, not just two. Correlation ≠ causation. Popularity ≠ correctness. Evidence beats emotion. Question assumptions. Think critically.

## Ad Hominem (Attack the Person)

```
Pattern: Attack the person instead of their argument

Example 1:
"You can't trust John's climate change research. 
He drives an SUV!"
❌ His vehicle choice doesn't invalidate his research

Example 2:
"Why should we listen to your economic policy? 
You're not even rich!"
❌ Personal wealth doesn't determine argument validity

Correct Response:
Address the research/policy on its merits
```

## Straw Man

```
Pattern: Misrepresent opponent's argument, then attack the distortion

Example 1:
Person A: "We should have more bike lanes for safety."
Person B: "So you want to ban all cars? That's ridiculous!"
❌ Person A never said ban cars

Example 2:
Person A: "Police need better training."
Person B: "You want to abolish all law enforcement!"
❌ Training ≠ abolishment

Correct Response:
"No, I said [original argument]. Address that instead."
```

## False Dilemma (False Binary)

```
Pattern: Present only two options when more exist

Example 1:
"You're either with us or against us."
❌ Ignores neutral positions, partial agreement

Example 2:
"Either we cut all social programs or the economy collapses."
❌ Many options between these extremes

Example 3:
"Love it or leave it!"
❌ Can love country and want improvements

Reality: Most issues have spectrum of positions
```

## Slippery Slope

```
Pattern: Claim one step inevitably leads to extreme outcome

Example 1:
"If we allow gay marriage, next people will marry animals!"
❌ No logical connection, each evaluated separately

Example 2:
"If we raise minimum wage by $1, businesses will all close!"
❌ Assumes inevitable chain without evidence

Example 3:
"Let students retake one test, soon they'll retake everything!"
❌ Assumes no boundaries possible

Valid Slippery Slope: Must show actual causal chain
```

## Appeal to Authority

```
Pattern: "Expert says X, therefore X is true"

Example 1:
"Einstein believed in God, so God exists."
❌ Expertise in physics ≠ expertise in theology

Example 2:
"This celebrity uses Brand X vitamins, so they work!"
❌ Celebrity endorsement ≠ scientific evidence

Example 3:
"My doctor friend said climate change is fake."
❌ Doctor ≠ climate scientist

Valid Authority: Relevant expert in their field
```

## Appeal to Emotion

```
Pattern: Use emotions instead of logic

Appeal to Fear:
"Don't vaccinate your kids—think of all that could go wrong!"
❌ Fear without evidence

Appeal to Pity:
"Give me an A—my grandmother just died."
❌ Sad situation doesn't change work quality

Appeal to Flattery:
"Smart people like you know this product is best."
❌ Flattery isn't evidence

Valid Emotion: Can complement logic, not replace it
```

## Hasty Generalization

```
Pattern: Draw broad conclusion from small sample

Example 1:
"I met two rude New Yorkers. All New Yorkers are rude!"
❌ Two people ≠ entire city

Example 2:
"My friend got sick after vaccination. Vaccines are dangerous!"
❌ Single case ≠ general safety profile

Example 3:
"This JavaScript framework failed once. All JS is bad!"
❌ One tool/instance ≠ entire language

Need: Adequate sample size, representative data
```

## Circular Reasoning (Begging the Question)

```
Pattern: Conclusion restates premise

Example 1:
"The Bible is true because it says so in the Bible."
❌ Uses conclusion as premise

Example 2:
"This law is good because it's the right thing to do."
❌ "Good" and "right" are same claim

Example 3:
"I'm trustworthy because I never lie."
❌ Being trustworthy means not lying—circular

Need: Independent evidence
```

## Red Herring

```
Pattern: Distract with irrelevant information

Example 1:
Person A: "You're late to work again."
Person B: "What about Tom? He takes long lunches!"
❌ Tom's lunches don't excuse lateness

Example 2:
"Why focus on local crime when there's a war overseas?"
❌ One issue doesn't negate the other

Example 3:
"You say I spend too much, but remember when you..."
❌ Deflection to avoid main point

Stay Focused: Address original argument
```

## Appeal to Tradition

```
Pattern: "We've always done it this way"

Example 1:
"Marriage has always been between man and woman."
❌ Tradition doesn't equal correctness

Example 2:
"We've always used this technology stack."
❌ Better tools may exist

Example 3:
"Manual testing worked for 20 years, why automate?"
❌ Long use doesn't mean optimal

Valid: Tradition can inform, but needs justification
```

## Appeal to Novelty

```
Pattern: "New is always better"

Example 1:
"This new framework just came out—we should use it!"
❌ New ≠ better or stable

Example 2:
"Traditional methods are outdated. Use this new diet!"
❌ Old methods might work better

Example 3:
"Our competitor uses AI, so we must too!"
❌ Novelty without purpose

Valid: Evaluate new vs old on merits
```

## Post Hoc (False Cause)

```
Pattern: "A happened before B, so A caused B"

Full name: Post hoc ergo propter hoc
("After this, therefore because of this")

Example 1:
"I wore my lucky socks and we won the game!"
❌ Correlation ≠ causation

Example 2:
"Crime dropped after new mayor elected."
❌ Many factors affect crime rates

Example 3:
"I got sick after the new restaurant opened."
❌ Timing doesn't prove causation

Need: Demonstrate actual causal mechanism
```

## Tu Quoque (You Too)

```
Pattern: "You do it too, so your criticism is invalid"

Example 1:
"You tell me to quit smoking, but you smoke!"
❌ Hypocrisy doesn't invalidate argument

Example 2:
"America criticizes human rights? They have problems too!"
❌ Others' faults don't excuse yours

Example 3:
"You say my code is messy, but yours has bugs!"
❌ Deflection doesn't address messiness

Reality: Argument stands independently of speaker
```

## Bandwagon (Appeal to Popularity)

```
Pattern: "Everyone does/believes it, so it's right"

Example 1:
"50 million users can't be wrong!"
❌ Popularity ≠ quality

Example 2:
"All the cool developers use React."
❌ Popularity doesn't mean best for your needs

Example 3:
"Everyone cheats on taxes a little."
❌ Common practice ≠ ethical

Valid: Popularity can indicate value, but isn't proof
```

## No True Scotsman

```
Pattern: Defend generalization by excluding counterexamples

Example 1:
Person A: "No Scotsman puts sugar on porridge."
Person B: "My uncle is Scottish and does."
Person A: "Well, no TRUE Scotsman does."
❌ Moving goalposts

Example 2:
"Real programmers use Vim."
"I'm a programmer and use VS Code."
"Real programmers use Vim!"
❌ Arbitrary redefinition

Example 3:
"Christians don't sin."
"But this Christian committed murder."
"He's not a true Christian then."
❌ Protects claim by redefining terms
```

## False Equivalence

```
Pattern: Treat very different things as equivalent

Example 1:
"Speeding and murder are both crimes, equally bad."
❌ Severity matters

Example 2:
"Scientists disagree on details, just like flat-earthers."
❌ Scientific debate ≠ denying established facts

Example 3:
"Bug in my code vs. security breach are both mistakes."
❌ Impact and scale differ greatly

Reality: Differences in degree matter
```

## Loaded Question

```
Pattern: Question assumes unproven premise

Example 1:
"Have you stopped beating your wife?"
❌ Assumes you were beating her

Example 2:
"Why is your code so bad?"
❌ Assumes code is bad

Example 3:
"When did you become so lazy?"
❌ Assumes current laziness

Correct: Challenge the premise first
```

## Middle Ground Fallacy

```
Pattern: "Truth must be in the middle"

Example 1:
Person A: "2 + 2 = 4"
Person B: "2 + 2 = 6"
Compromise: "2 + 2 = 5"
❌ Middle ground isn't always correct

Example 2:
"Some say climate change is real, others say fake.
Truth must be somewhere in between."
❌ One side might be completely right

Example 3:
"Let's compromise: 50% test coverage."
❌ Maybe 80% is objectively better

Reality: Sometimes one position is correct
```

## Genetic Fallacy

```
Pattern: Judge argument by its origin

Example 1:
"That idea came from Reddit, so it's worthless."
❌ Source doesn't determine validity

Example 2:
"Hitler supported animal rights, so animal rights are bad."
❌ Bad person can have good ideas

Example 3:
"That's a junior dev's suggestion, ignore it."
❌ Good ideas come from anywhere

Valid: Evaluate idea on merits, not origin
```

## Anecdotal Evidence

```
Pattern: Use personal experience as proof

Example 1:
"My grandfather smoked and lived to 90, so smoking is safe!"
❌ Single case doesn't override statistics

Example 2:
"I never wear a seatbelt and never got hurt."
❌ Personal luck ≠ general safety

Example 3:
"This framework worked for my project, so it's the best!"
❌ One success doesn't mean universal solution

Valid: Anecdotes illustrate, but don't prove
```

## Texas Sharpshooter

```
Pattern: Cherry-pick data to fit conclusion

Example 1:
Shoot wall randomly, then draw target around hits.
Claim: "Perfect shot every time!"
❌ Pattern created after the fact

Example 2:
"Look at all the predictions I got right!"
(Ignores all the wrong ones)
❌ Selection bias

Example 3:
"These 3 studies prove my point."
(Ignores 20 studies that contradict)
❌ Cherry-picking data

Need: Consider all relevant data
```

## Avoiding Fallacies

```javascript
// ✅ Steel man opponent's argument
// Strengthen their position before responding
const opponentArgument = strongest_version(argument);
respond(opponentArgument);

// ✅ Check your own reasoning
if (attacking_person_not_argument) {
  fallacy = 'ad_hominem';
}

// ✅ Ask for evidence
claim = "Everyone uses this framework";
response = "Can you provide usage statistics?";

// ✅ Identify the logical structure
premise1 = "A is true";
premise2 = "B is true";
conclusion = "Therefore C";
// Does C follow from A and B?

// ✅ Consider alternative explanations
observed = "Sales increased after new website";
possible_causes = [
  "New website drove sales",
  "Seasonal trend",
  "Marketing campaign",
  "Competitor closed"
];

// ❌ Don't use fallacies to win
winning_argument = build_sound_argument(evidence);
// not: attack_person(), distract(), appeal_to_emotion()

// ❌ Don't dismiss argument due to fallacy
// Address the core claim even if reasoning is flawed
```

## Spotting Fallacies

```
Questions to ask:

1. "Does the conclusion follow logically?"
   If no → formal fallacy

2. "Is this addressing the argument or something else?"
   If something else → red herring, ad hominem

3. "Are there unstated assumptions?"
   May reveal hidden fallacy

4. "What evidence supports this?"
   Lack of evidence → appeal to authority, emotion

5. "Am I being emotionally manipulated?"
   Fear, pity, flattery → appeal to emotion

6. "Are all options being considered?"
   If no → false dilemma

7. "Is this a fair representation?"
   If no → straw man
```
