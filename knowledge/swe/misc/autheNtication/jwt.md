# JWT Tokens: A Concise Overview

JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims between two parties. They are widely used for authentication and authorization in web applications.

## Key Points

- **Structure:** JWTs consist of three parts: header, payload, and signature.
- **Stateless:** JWTs are self-contained and do not require server-side session storage.
- **Security:** The signature ensures integrity and authenticity, but not confidentiality.
- **Transport:** JWTs are commonly transmitted via HTTP headers (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer <token>`).
- **Expiration:** Tokens can include an expiration (`exp`) claim for automatic invalidation.

## Step-by-Step Explanation & Examples

1. **Creating a JWT (Node.js Example)**
   ```js
   const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
   const token = jwt.sign({ userId: 123 }, 'secret', { expiresIn: '1h' });
   ```

2. **Decoding and Verifying a JWT**
   ```js
   const decoded = jwt.verify(token, 'secret');
   console.log(decoded.userId); // 123
   ```

3. **JWT Structure**
   ```
   eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.  // header (base64)
   eyJ1c2VySWQiOjEyMywiZXhwIjoxNjAwMDAwMDB9.  // payload (base64)
   SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c  // signature
   ```

## Common Pitfalls

- **Storing Sensitive Data:** Never put secrets or passwords in the payload; JWTs are only base64-encoded, not encrypted.
- **Token Expiry:** Failing to handle expired tokens can lead to security issues.
- **Signature Verification:** Always verify the signature before trusting the tokenâ€™s contents.
- **Algorithm Confusion:** Be explicit about the signing algorithm to avoid vulnerabilities.

## Practical Applications

- Stateless authentication for APIs and web apps.
- Authorization for protected routes and resources.
- Single sign-on (SSO) implementations.

### Advanced Concepts

- **Refresh Tokens:** Use long-lived refresh tokens to obtain new JWTs without re-authenticating.
- **Token Revocation:** Implement blacklists or short expiration times to mitigate risks from stolen tokens.
- **Custom Claims:** Add custom claims (e.g., roles, permissions) to support fine-grained authorization.
