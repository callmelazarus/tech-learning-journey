# Time Complexity for Algorithms: A Detailed Overview

Time complexity measures how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the input size increases. It is a key metric for evaluating and comparing algorithms, helping engineers choose efficient solutions for different problems.

| Complexity | Name         | Example Algorithm     | Growth Rate Description                  |
| ---------- | ------------ | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |

| O(n^2)     | Quadratic    | Bubble sort           | Grows rapidly, nested loops              |
| O(2^n)     | Exponential  | Recursive Fibonacci   | Doubles with each input increase         |

- **Big O Notation:** Standard way to express time complexity (e.g., O(1), O(n), O(log n), O(n^2)).
- **Growth Rate:** Indicates how quickly runtime increases with input size.
- **Common Complexities:** Each algorithm has a typical time complexity based on its structure.
- **Worst, Best, Average Case:** Complexity can be analyzed for different scenarios.
- **Scalability:** Time complexity helps predict performance for large inputs.
- **Hidden Costs:** Constants and lower-order terms can affect real-world performance.
- **Algorithm Choice:** Guides selection of algorithms for specific use cases.

## Step-by-Step Explanation & Examples

### 1. Constant Time: O(1)

- **Description:** Runtime does not depend on input size.
- **Example:**
  ```js
  function getFirst(arr) {
    return arr[0];
  }
  ```

### 2. Linear Time: O(n)

- **Description:** Runtime grows proportionally with input size.
- **Example:**
  ```js
  function sum(arr) {
    let total = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
      total += arr[i];
    }
    return total;
  }
  ```

### 3. Logarithmic Time: O(log n)

- **Description:** Runtime grows logarithmically; input is divided in each step.
- **Example:**
  ```js
  function binarySearch(arr, target) {
    let left = 0,
      right = arr.length - 1;
    while (left <= right) {
      const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
      if (arr[mid] === target) return mid;
      if (arr[mid] < target) left = mid + 1;
      else right = mid - 1;
    }
    return -1;
  }
  ```

### 4. Quadratic Time: O(n^2)

- **Description:** Runtime grows with the square of input size; often from nested loops.
- **Example:**
  ```js
  function bubbleSort(arr) {
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
      for (let j = 0; j < arr.length - 1; j++) {
        if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
          [arr[j], arr[j + 1]] = [arr[j + 1], arr[j]];
        }
      }
    }
    return arr;
  }
  ```

### 5. Linearithmic Time: O(n log n)

- **Description:** Common in efficient sorting algorithms.
- **Example:**
  - Merge Sort, QuickSort (average case)

## Common Pitfalls

- Misinterpreting Big O notation (e.g., confusing O(n) with O(1)).
- Ignoring worst-case scenarios.
- Over-optimizing for time and neglecting other factors (space, readability).
- Not considering hidden constants or lower-order terms.

## Practical Applications

- Choosing the right algorithm for large datasets.
- Optimizing code for performance-critical systems.
- Interviewing and technical assessments.
- Evaluating trade-offs in resource-constrained environments.
