# Tree-Shaking and `sideEffects` in Modern JavaScript Projects

Tree-shaking is a build optimization technique used by modern JavaScript bundlers (like Webpack, Rollup, and esbuild) to eliminate unused code from final bundles. This helps reduce bundle size and improve application performance.

## What is Tree-Shaking?

Tree-shaking analyzes your codebase and removes exports that are never imported or used. It relies on ES module syntax (`import`/`export`) for static analysis.

**Example:**
If a module exports multiple functions but only one is imported elsewhere, tree-shaking can remove the unused exports from the bundle.

## The Role of `sideEffects`

Some modules perform actions when imported, such as modifying global state, registering plugins, or polyfilling features. These are called "side effects."

Bundlers use the `sideEffects` field in `package.json` to determine which files are safe to remove. If a file is marked as having no side effects, the bundler can safely exclude it if it's unused.

**Example `package.json`:**
```json
{
  "sideEffects": false
}
```
This tells the bundler that importing any file in the package does not cause side effects.

Alternatively, you can specify files that do have side effects:
```json
{
  "sideEffects": ["*.css", "./src/setupGlobals.js"]
}
```

## Best Practices

- Use ES modules for maximum tree-shaking benefits.
- Explicitly declare `sideEffects` in your package to help bundlers optimize safely.
- Avoid side effects in modules unless necessary.
