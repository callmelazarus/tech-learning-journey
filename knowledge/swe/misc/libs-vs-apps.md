# Shared Libraries vs Applications in Large Monorepos

In large monorepos, codebases often contain both shared libraries (libs) and standalone applications (apps). Understanding the differences and best practices for managing each is crucial for maintainability, scalability, and developer productivity.

## Shared Libraries (Libs)

- **Purpose:** Provide reusable functionality, utilities, or components that can be consumed by multiple applications within the monorepo.
- **Characteristics:**
  - Decoupled from specific business logic
  - Well-documented APIs
  - Versioned and tested independently
  - Minimal dependencies on applications
- **Benefits:**
  - Code reuse
  - Consistency across projects
  - Easier maintenance and bug fixes

## Applications (Apps)

- **Purpose:** Deliver end-user functionality, typically as deployable products or services.
- **Characteristics:**
  - Integrate multiple libraries
  - Contain business logic and user interfaces
  - Have their own deployment pipelines
  - May depend on several shared libs
- **Benefits:**
  - Clear ownership and boundaries
  - Focused on delivering value to users
  - Can evolve independently

## Key Differences

| Aspect         | Shared Libraries (Libs) | Applications (Apps) |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------- |
| Reusability    | High                    | Low                 |
| Business Logic | None/Minimal            | Core                |
| Testing        | Unit/Integration        | End-to-end          |
| Deployment     | Not deployed directly   | Deployed to users   |
| Dependencies   | Minimal                 | Can be many         |

## Best Practices in Monorepos

- Clearly separate libs and apps in directory structure
- Use automated tests for both libs and apps
- Document APIs for shared libs
- Manage dependencies carefully to avoid tight coupling
- Use CI/CD pipelines to ensure quality and integration
