# Error Logging Standards: A Concise Overview

Error logging standards define best practices for capturing, formatting, and managing error information in software systems. Adhering to these standards improves debugging, monitoring, and system reliability.

## Key Points

- **Consistency:** Use a uniform format for error messages and logs.
- **Context:** Include relevant metadata (timestamp, severity, environment, user/session info).
- **Levels:** Distinguish between error levels (error, warning, info, debug).
- **Traceability:** Log stack traces and error codes for easier troubleshooting.
- **Security:** Avoid logging sensitive data (e.g., passwords, personal info).

## Step-by-Step Explanation & Examples

1. **Structured Logging Example (JSON)**
   ```json
   {
     "timestamp": "2025-09-16T12:34:56Z",
     "level": "error",
     "message": "Database connection failed",
     "errorCode": "DB_CONN_ERR",
     "stack": "Error: ...",
     "userId": "12345"
   }
   ```

2. **Logging in Code (Node.js Example)**
   ```js
   logger.error('Database connection failed', {
     errorCode: 'DB_CONN_ERR',
     stack: err.stack,
     userId: req.user.id
   });
   ```

3. **Error Levels**
   - `error`: Critical failures
   - `warn`: Recoverable issues
   - `info`: General events
   - `debug`: Detailed diagnostic info

## Common Pitfalls

- Logging too little or too much information.
- Failing to log errors at the correct level.
- Not rotating or archiving logs, leading to disk space issues.
- Logging sensitive or personally identifiable information.

## Practical Applications

- Monitoring and alerting in production systems.
- Auditing and compliance.
- Debugging and root cause analysis.

### Advanced Concepts

- **Centralized Logging:** Use tools like ELK Stack, Splunk, or cloud logging services for aggregation and analysis.
- **Correlation IDs:** Track requests across distributed systems for end-to-end tracing.
- **Log Sampling & Rate Limiting:** Prevent log flooding in high-traffic environments.
- **Automated Alerting:** Integrate with monitoring systems to trigger
