# Event Handling and Interaction Precedence in UI Component Libraries

Understanding how events are handled and prioritized in nested UI components is crucial for building intuitive and bug-free interfaces.

## Key Points

- **Event Propagation:** Events bubble up from child to parent unless stopped.
- **Default Behaviors:** Parent components may have default actions that can override or conflict with child events.
- **Custom Handlers:** Use event methods (e.g., `stopPropagation`, `preventDefault`) to control event flow.
- **Focus and Selection:** UI libraries often manage focus and selection, which can affect event handling.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure custom event handling does not break keyboard or screen reader navigation.

## Step-by-Step Explanation & Examples

1. **Nested Event Example**
   ```jsx
   <Parent onClick={() => console.log('Parent clicked')}>
     <Child onClick={e => {
       e.stopPropagation();
       console.log('Child clicked');
     }} />
   </Parent>
   ```
   - Clicking Child logs "Child clicked" only.

2. **Overriding Default Behavior**
   - Use `preventDefault` to stop default actions (e.g., form submission, dropdown closing).

3. **Managing State**
   - Update state in the correct component to reflect user actions.

## Common Pitfalls

- Not stopping propagation, causing unwanted parent actions.
- Overriding default behaviors unintentionally.
- Losing focus or selection state due to custom event handling.

## Practical Applications

- Custom dropdowns with removable selections.
- Interactive lists or tag pickers.
- Complex forms with nested controls.
