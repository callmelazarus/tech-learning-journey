# SQL Basics: A Well-Structured Overview

SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language for managing and querying relational databases. Mastering SQL is essential for software engineers working with data-driven applications.

## Key Points

- **Declarative Language:** SQL describes what data to retrieve, not how to retrieve it.
- **Core Operations:** CRUD—Create, Read, Update, Delete—are the foundation of SQL.
- **Tables and Schemas:** Data is organized in tables with defined columns and types.
- **Joins:** Combine data from multiple tables using INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, and FULL JOINs.
- **Filtering and Sorting:** Use `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, and `GROUP BY` to refine results.
- **Aggregation:** Functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, and `MAX` summarize data.
- **Parameterized Queries:** Prevent SQL injection and improve query safety.

## Step-by-Step Explanation & Examples

1. **Selecting Data**
   ```sql
   SELECT name, age FROM users WHERE active = true ORDER BY age DESC;
   ```

2. **Inserting Data**
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO users (name, age, active) VALUES ('Ada', 30, true);
   ```

3. **Updating Data**
   ```sql
   UPDATE users SET active = false WHERE age < 18;
   ```

4. **Deleting Data**
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM users WHERE active = false;
   ```

5. **Joining Tables**
   ```sql
   SELECT users.name, orders.amount
   FROM users
   INNER JOIN orders ON users.id = orders.user_id;
   ```

6. **Aggregating Data**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE active = true;
   ```

## Common Pitfalls

- Forgetting to use `WHERE` in `UPDATE` or `DELETE` (can affect all rows).
- Not using parameterized queries, risking SQL injection.
- Misunderstanding join types, leading to missing or duplicate data.
- Overusing subqueries or complex joins, hurting performance.

## Practical Applications

- Building web and mobile apps with persistent data.
- Generating reports and analytics.
- Data migration and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes.
- Integrating with business intelligence tools.

### Advanced Concepts

- **Indexes:** Speed up queries by creating efficient lookup structures.
- **Transactions:** Ensure data integrity with atomic operations (`BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`).
- **Views:** Create virtual tables for reusable queries.
- **Stored Procedures:** Encapsulate logic in the database for reuse and performance.
- **Normalization/Denormalization:** Organize data to reduce redundancy or optimize for performance.
- **Window Functions:** Perform advanced analytics
