# AWS Disaster Recovery: A Well-Structured Overview

AWS Disaster Recovery (DR) encompasses strategies and services for protecting applications and data from outages, ensuring business continuity through backup, replication, and failover mechanisms across AWS infrastructure.

## Key Points

- **Definition:** A set of policies, tools, and procedures to recover or continue technology infrastructure and systems following a natural or human-induced disaster.
- **RTO & RPO:** Recovery Time Objective (how quickly you recover) and Recovery Point Objective (how much data loss is acceptable) drive DR strategy selection.
- **DR Strategies:** AWS offers four primary approaches: Backup & Restore, Pilot Light, Warm Standby, and Multi-Site Active/Active, each with different cost-performance trade-offs.
- **Geographic Redundancy:** Leverage multiple AWS Regions and Availability Zones to protect against regional failures.
- **Automation:** Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation, Terraform) and automated failover reduce recovery time and human error.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Pay only for resources used, scaling DR infrastructure up during disasters and down during normal operations.
- **Testing:** Regular DR drills validate recovery procedures and identify gaps before actual disasters occur.

## Step-by-Step Explanation & Examples

1. **Backup & Restore Strategy (Lowest Cost)**
   ```bash
   # Automated EBS snapshots
   aws ec2 create-snapshot --volume-id vol-1234567890abcdef0 \
     --description "Daily backup"
   
   # S3 cross-region replication for data backup
   aws s3api put-bucket-replication --bucket source-bucket \
     --replication-configuration file://replication.json
   
   # RDS automated backups (retention period)
   aws rds modify-db-instance --db-instance-identifier mydb \
     --backup-retention-period 7
   ```

2. **Pilot Light Strategy (Core Services Running)**
   ```yaml
   # CloudFormation template for minimal infrastructure
   Resources:
     MinimalRDSInstance:
       Type: AWS::RDS::DBInstance
       Properties:
         DBInstanceClass: db.t3.micro  # Small instance always running
         AllocatedStorage: 20
         Engine: postgres
     
     # Application servers launched only during failover
     ApplicationASG:
       Type: AWS::AutoScaling::AutoScalingGroup
       Properties:
         MinSize: 0  # Zero instances normally
         MaxSize: 10
         DesiredCapacity: 0
   ```

3. **Warm Standby Strategy (Scaled-Down Production)**
   ```bash
   # Route 53 health checks and failover routing
   aws route53 create-health-check --health-check-config \
     IPAddress=203.0.113.1,Port=80,Type=HTTP,ResourcePath=/health
   
   # Auto Scaling to quickly scale up during disaster
   aws autoscaling set-desired-capacity \
     --auto-scaling-group-name dr-asg --desired-capacity 10
   ```

4. **Multi-Site Active/Active Strategy**
   ```bash
   # Route 53 weighted routing across regions
   aws route53 change-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id Z123456 \
     --change-batch file://weighted-routing.json
   
   # DynamoDB Global Tables for multi-region writes
   aws dynamodb create-global-table --global-table-name users \
     --replication-group RegionName=us-east-1 RegionName=us-west-2
   ```

5. **Testing DR Procedures**
   ```python
   # Automate DR failover testing
   import boto3
   
   # Simulate failover by switching Route 53 records
   route53 = boto3.client('route53')
   response = route53.change_resource_record_sets(
       HostedZoneId='Z123456',
       ChangeBatch={
           'Changes': [{
               'Action': 'UPSERT',
               'ResourceRecordSet': {
                   'Name': 'app.example.com',
                   'Type': 'A',
                   'SetIdentifier': 'DR-Region',
                   'Weight': 100,
                   'AliasTarget': {
                       'HostedZoneId': 'Z789012',
                       'DNSName': 'dr-alb.us-west-2.amazonaws.com'
                   }
               }
           }]
       }
   )
   ```

## Common Pitfalls

- Choosing a DR strategy without clearly defining RTO and RPO requirements, leading to over/under-investment.
- Never testing DR procedures—discovering gaps during an actual disaster is too late.
- Forgetting to replicate supporting resources (security groups, IAM roles, configurations) to the DR region.
- Not accounting for cross-region data transfer costs, which can be substantial during failover.
- Assuming automated backups alone are sufficient—backups don't protect against application-level corruption.
- Ignoring DNS TTL settings—high TTLs delay failover when switching Route 53 records.
- Not documenting runbooks or automating failover procedures, leading to confusion during high-stress incidents.

## Practical Applications

- **E-commerce Platforms:** Multi-region active/active setup to prevent revenue loss during regional outages.
- **Financial Services:** Warm standby with <1 hour RTO for regulatory compliance and customer trust.
- **SaaS Applications:** Pilot light for cost-effective protection with acceptable 4-6 hour recovery windows.
- **Content Delivery:** S3 + CloudFront with cross-region replication for media and static assets.

**Example anecdote:** During my time working on a critical system, we had a "pilot light" DR setup that looked great on paper. During a scheduled DR test, we discovered our automation scripts hadn't been updated after a recent refactor—they referenced old AMI IDs. What should've been a 30-minute failover took 4 hours. Now we test quarterly and version-control all DR automation alongside application code.

### Advanced Concepts

- **DR Strategy Comparison:**
  - **Backup & Restore:** RPO/RTO in hours, lowest cost, suitable for non-critical workloads
  - **Pilot Light:** RPO in minutes, RTO in 10s of minutes, minimal infrastructure always running
  - **Warm Standby:** RPO/RTO in seconds to minutes, scaled-down version always running
  - **Multi-Site Active/Active:** Near-zero RPO/RTO, highest cost, full production capacity in multiple regions
- **AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery (DRS):** Automated continuous replication and orchestrated failover/failback for physical, virtual, and cloud servers.
- **AWS Backup:** Centralized backup service supporting EBS, RDS, DynamoDB, EFS, S3, and more with policy-based backup plans.
- **Cross-Region Replication:** Available for S3, RDS, Aurora, DynamoDB Global Tables, and ECR for geographic redundancy.
- **CloudEndure Migration:** Lift-and-shift migration tool that can also serve as DR solution with continuous replication.
- **RDS Read Replicas:** Promote read replicas to standalone instances in DR scenarios for database recovery.
- **Aurora Global Database:** Single Aurora database spanning multiple regions with <1 second replication lag and <1 minute RTO.
- **S3 Versioning & Object Lock:** Protect against accidental deletions and ransomware with immutable backups.
- **AWS Resilience Hub:** Assess, validate, and track application resilience against DR targets.
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Use CloudFormation, CDK, or Terraform to version and quickly rebuild infrastructure in DR regions.
- **Chaos Engineering:** Practice GameDays and use AWS Fault Injection Simulator to test system resilience proactively.
- **Data Consistency:** Understand eventual consistency implications in multi-region active/active architectures.
- **Network Considerations:** Pre-establish VPN connections, Direct Connect links, and VPC peering in DR regions.
- **Compliance Requirements:** HIPAA, SOC 2, PCI-DSS may mandate specific RPO/RTO targets and geographic data residency.
- **Cost Optimization:** Use S3 Glacier for long-term backup retention, stopped EC2 instances in pilot light, and Reserved Instances for warm standby.
- **Runbook Automation:** AWS Systems Manager Automation documents to orchestrate multi-step failover procedures.
- **Monitoring & Alerting:** CloudWatch alarms, SNS notifications, and EventBridge rules to trigger automated DR responses.
- **Failback Procedures:** Plan for returning to primary region after disaster resolved—often more complex than failover.
