# Basic Most Popular AWS Services: A Well-Structured Overview

Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a wide range of cloud services that help engineers build, deploy, and scale applications. Understanding the most popular AWS services is essential for modern software development and DevOps.

## Key Points

- **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):** Provides scalable virtual servers for running applications.
- **S3 (Simple Storage Service):** Object storage for files, backups, and static assets.
- **RDS (Relational Database Service):** Managed relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).
- **Lambda:** Serverless compute service for running code in response to events.
- **DynamoDB:** Managed NoSQL database for fast and flexible data storage.
- **IAM (Identity and Access Management):** Controls user and service permissions.
- **CloudWatch:** Monitoring and logging for AWS resources and applications.

## Step-by-Step Explanation & Examples

1. **Launching an EC2 Instance**
   ```sh
   aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-12345678 --count 1 --instance-type t2.micro
   ```

2. **Storing a File in S3**
   ```js
   // Using AWS SDK for JavaScript
   const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
   const s3 = new AWS.S3();
   s3.putObject({ Bucket: 'my-bucket', Key: 'file.txt', Body: 'Hello AWS!' }, callback);
   ```

3. **Creating a Lambda Function**
   ```js
   exports.handler = async (event) => {
     return { statusCode: 200, body: 'Hello from Lambda!' };
   };
   ```

4. **Querying DynamoDB**
   ```js
   const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
   const dynamo = new AWS.DynamoDB.DocumentClient();
   dynamo.get({ TableName: 'Users', Key: { userId: '123' } }, callback);
   ```

## Common Pitfalls

- Misconfiguring IAM roles, leading to security vulnerabilities.
- Not setting up proper monitoring and alerts (CloudWatch).
- Over-provisioning resources, resulting in unnecessary costs.
- Ignoring region selection, which can affect latency and compliance.

## Practical Applications

- Hosting web and mobile applications.
- Storing and serving static assets.
- Building scalable APIs and microservices.
- Managing user authentication and permissions.
- Real-time data processing and analytics.
